# Samsung Tutorial for Deep NLP class
This project is for beginners who want to find an easy way to practice deep nlp model with Tensorflow. The repository gives 3 contents to practice and understand Deep NLP. 
* Word2Vec Examples with Gensim Framework
* Sentiment Analysis Model with Recurrent Neural Network and Convolution Neural Network
* Simple Seq2Seq model for translating an English word to Korean word in character level

In addition, I added basic Markov model based ChatBot and simple Seq2Seq based ChatBot examples, and Seq2Seq ChatBot project is originally referred from the link down below.
* Reference : https://github.com/golbin/TensorFlow-Tutorials/tree/master/10%20-%20RNN/ChatBot
